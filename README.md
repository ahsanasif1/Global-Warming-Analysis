# Global-Warming-Analysis
Analyzing the daily temperature dataset and performing a Global Warming Analysis.

Data
Overview :
The rising average temperature of Earth's climate system, called global warming, is driving changes in rainfall patterns, extreme weather, arrival of seasons, and more. Collectively, global warming and its effects are known as climate change. While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming, observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale. So a dataset on the temperature of major cities of the world will help analyze the same. Also weather information is helpful for a lot of data science tasks like sales forecasting, logistics etc. The data is available for research and non-commercial purposes only.
